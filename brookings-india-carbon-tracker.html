            <h2>About the tracker</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="question">What is this?</span>
                <p class="answer">The Brookings India Electricity and Carbon Tracker is a near-real-time tracker
                    that shows electricity generated by source (eg Renewable, Thermal) at a national level.
                    It also shows total electricity-based CO<sub>2</sub> emissions every 5 minutes and CO<sub>2</sub>
                    emissions per kWh. Additionally, it displays the moving averages for each generation source,
                    as well as a wide variety of summary statistics and analysis.</p>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="question">Why is this important?</span>
                <p class="answer">This India electricity tracker is the first of its kind focusing on
                    high-resolution and near-real-time data. <br><br>
                    Till now, national electricity generation data was only available on a daily basis, as energy (kWh).
                    This tracker focuses on capacity (kW) over time, which makes it possible to draw patterns and
                    inferences about electricity generation in the country for planning and policy purposes.
                    For example, it helps us see Carbon Intensity of the grid at a granular time-varying level,
                    thus identifying time instances when the grid is the "greenest",
                    or the relative contribution of (and thus value of) different types of
                    generators at different times. </p>

                <span class="answer">The interface is different based on your device.
                    A computer is recommended over a mobile device or tablet as it allows a richer interface.</span>

                <span class="question">Choosing the time period</span>
                <span class="answer">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Computers default to the current week's generation data</li>
                        <li>Mobiles/Tablets default to the Summary Statistics and Analysis page</li>
                    </ul>
                </span>
                <span class="question">Choosing the type of output</span>
                <span class="answer">
                    <p>Using the second selector at the top,
                        one can choose between several types of views or results:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Corrected Generation Data (with limited corrections)</li>
                        <li>Raw Generation Data</li>
                        <li>Moving Averages</li>
                        <li>Summary Statistics and Analysis</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The first two options, at a 5 minute resolution, also show CO2 from electricity generation,
                        both per kWh as well as total tons per 5 minute period.</p>
                </span>
                <span class="question">Navigating the data</span>
                <span class="answer">
                    <p>{Note: Mobile/tablet interfaces lose the ability to have mouse-overs}</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The legend on the side shows different data sets available, and clicking on a type
                            (such as renewable) toggles between showing or hiding that data set.</li>
                        <li>Double-clicking on a legend data label isolates that particular data set.
                            Others can then be added one-by-one as desired by clicking on them.</li>
                        <li>Moving the mouse enables a set of navigation options that include
                            <ul>
                                <li>Zoom - click and drag with the mouse to zoom</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>You can also manually change the Y-axes by either panning them up or down,
                            or changing the upper/lower bounds by scrolling from the top/bottom ends of the Y-axes.</li>
                        <li>The Summary Statistics and Analysis page shows some interesting statistics for the period
                            you have selected, such as total tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted,
                            and the average daily peak generation in MW, share of RE by time of day, etc.</li>

                <span class="question">Data</span>
                <span class="answer">
                    <ul>
                        <li>We receive data every 3 minutes, as national generation by source in MW, as well as
                            national demand met in MW</li>
                        <li>This data comes via the SCADA system</li>
                    </ul>
                </span>
                <span class="question">Methodology</span>
                <span class="answer">
                    <ul>
                        <li>The data is then rounded to the preceding 5-minute interval, which you can see under
                            <b>Raw Generation Data</b></li>
                        <li>However, sometimes there are errors in this data where there is a sudden reduction in
                            generation from one or more sources. You can see an example of this on January 7th 2019
                            at 2:40 pm</li>
                        <li>We correct for these errors by boosting any generation source that has dropped by more than
                            10%. You can see this under <b>Corrected Generation Data</b></li>
                        <li><b>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</b> are calculated by converting generation by source to MWh for
                            each 5-minute block, and then multiplying by fixed emission factors for each source</li>
                        <li>The emission factors that we use are the <i>weighted average specific emission factors</i>
                            as mentioned in the report <i>CO2 Baseline Database for the Indian Power Sector</i>
                            (December 2018) published by the Central Electricity Authority.</i></li>
                        <li><b>gCO<sub>2</sub>/kWh</b> is calculated by dividing emissions by total generation for a
                            timestamp</li>
                        <li>For <b>Moving Averages</b> per timestamp, we calculate the average for a fixed period
                            preceding the timestamp. For example, for weekly moving averages for thermal generation at
                            a timestamp, we find the average thermal generation in MW over the 7 days before the
                            timestamp</li>
                    </ul>

                <span class="question">Limitations</span>
                <span class="answer">
                    <ul>
                        <li>The tracker only includes generation connected to the SCADA system. There is some non-SCADA
                            generation which is not included in the tracker, so actual generation (especially renewable
                            generation) may be higher.</li>
                        <li>We use flat emission factors for each source for all times of day. Additionally, the
                            emission factors for hydro, nuclear and renewable generation are 0. This means we do not
                            capture embedded and time-of-day variations in emissions</li>
